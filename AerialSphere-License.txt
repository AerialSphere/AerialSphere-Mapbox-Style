Aerial Sphere, LLC License, Agreement And Terms Of Use

This License Agreement and Terms of Use (the “Terms of Use”) is made and entered into between AerialSphere, LLC (“AerialSphere”) and the entity or person agreeing to these terms (“End User”).

This Agreement is effective as of the date End User clicks to accept the Agreement, or enters into a End User/Reseller Agreement if purchasing through a Reseller (the “Effective Date”). If you are accepting on behalf of End User, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind End User to this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of End User, to this Agreement. If you do not have the legal authority to bind End User, please do not click to accept. This Agreement governs End User’s access to and use of the Services.

1. Provision of the Services.
1. Use of the Services in End User Applications. AerialSphere will provide the Services to End User in accordance with this Agreement and/or applicable SLA.
2. Platform; API Keys. End User will administer the Services through the AerialSphere Platform. To access the Services, End User must create an Account (See Section 3), identify defined projects (each a “Project”) and use its API key(s) in accordance with the Documentation.
3. Accounts. End User must have an Account. End User is responsible for: (a) the information it provides in connection with the Account; (b) maintaining the confidentiality and security of the Account and associated passwords; and (c) any use of its Account.
4. End User Domains and Applications. End User must list each authorized domain and application that uses the Services in the AerialSphere Platform. End User is responsible for ensuring that only authorized domains and applications use the Services.
5. New Features and Services. AerialSphere may: (a) make new features or functionality available through the Services and (b) add new services to the Services definition. End User’s use of new features or functionality may be contingent on End User’s agreement to additional terms applicable to the new feature or functionality. The available Services are identified at app.aerialsphere.com/services
6. Modifications.
1. To the Services. AerialSphere may make changes to the Services at any time, which may include adding, updating, or discontinuing any Services or portion or feature(s) of the Services. AerialSphere will notify End User of any material change to the Services.
2. To the Agreement. AerialSphere may make changes to this Agreement, including pricing (and any linked documents). Unless otherwise noted by AerialSphere, material changes to the Agreement will become effective 30 days after notice is given, except if the changes apply to new functionality in which case they will be effective immediately. AerialSphere will provide at least 90 days’ advance notice for materially adverse changes to any SLA by: (a) sending an email to the email identified by End User in the Account; or (b) posting a notice in the AerialSphere Platform. If End User does not agree to the revised Agreement, End User should stop using the Services. AerialSphere will post any modification to this Agreement to the Terms of Use URL.
2. 
1. Free Services. Certain Services are provided to End User without charge (“Free Services”). Free Services will be accessible on the AerialSphere Platform without the payment of a Subscription Fee. AerialSphere reserves the right, at any time upon written notice to End User, to require the payment of Subscription Fees or Additional Fees with respect to Services that were previously classified as Free Services.
2. Subscription Services. Certain Services (“Subscription Services”) are provided to End User in exchange for a subscription fee (each a “Subscription Fee”) on a tier basis. The Subscription Fee you will pay is based upon the tier of Services that you selected. Subscription Fees accrued during a Fee Accrual Period will be billed automatically by AerialSphere on a regular basis (at intervals determined by AerialSphere). End User will pay all Subscription Fees in United States Dollars (“USD”). AerialSphere will charge (and End User will pay) all Subscription Fees immediately and automatically at the end of the Fee Accrual Period by credit card, debit card, ACH, EFT, or other similar automatic payment system or mechanism utilized by AerialSphere. End User’s obligation to pay Subscription Fees is non-cancellable. AerialSphere’s measurement of End User’s use of the Subscription Services is final.
3. Additional Services. Certain Services (“Additional Services”) may be provided to End User in exchange for an additional fee (each an “Additional Fee”). Additional Fees will be billed electronically when Additional Services are performed or on a Fee Accrual Period basis at the same time and in the same manner as Subscription Fees. End User will pay all Additional Fees in United States Dollars (“USD”). AerialSphere will charge (and End User will pay) all Additional Fees by credit card, debit card, ACH, EFT, or other similar automatic payment system or mechanism utilized by AerialSphere. Once an Additional Service is performed or provided, Additional Fees are not refundable except as approved by AerialSphere.
4. Taxes. End User is responsible for any Taxes and End User will pay AerialSphere for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If AerialSphere is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to End User, unless End User provides AerialSphere with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. In some states sales tax is due on the total purchase price at the time of sale and must be invoiced and collected at the time of the sale. If End User is required by law to withhold any Taxes from its payments to AerialSphere, End User must provide AerialSphere with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such withholding. If the Services are subject to local VAT and End User is required to make a withholding of local VAT from amounts payable to AerialSphere, the value of Services calculated in accordance with the above procedure will be increased (grossed up) by End User for the respective amount of local VAT and the grossed up amount will be regarded as a VAT inclusive price. Local VAT amount withheld from the VAT-inclusive price will be remitted to the applicable local tax entity by End User and End User will ensure that AerialSphere will receive payment for its services for the net amount as would otherwise be due (the VAT inclusive price less the local VAT withheld and remitted to applicable tax authority). If required under applicable law, End User will provide AerialSphere with applicable tax identification information that AerialSphere may require to ensure its compliance with applicable tax regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdictions. End User will be liable to pay (or reimburse AerialSphere for) any Taxes, interest, penalties or fines arising out of any violation of such regulations by End User.
5. Fee Disputes & Refunds. End User waives all claims relating to Fees unless claimed within 60 days after charged (this does not affect any End User rights with its credit card issuer). Refunds (if any) are at the discretion of AerialSphere and will only be in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this Agreement obligates AerialSphere to extend credit to any party.
6. Delinquent Payments; Suspension. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. End User will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by AerialSphere in collecting such delinquent amounts. If End User is late on payment for Services, AerialSphere may suspend the Services or terminate the Agreement for breach under Section 2 (Termination for Breach).
7. License Grant. Subject to this Agreement’s terms, during the Term, AerialSphere grants to End User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, license to use the Services in End User Application(s), which may be: (a) fee-based or non-fee-based; (b) public/external or private/internal; (c) business-to-business; or (d) business-to-consumer subject to certain conditions specified below.

4. No Use with Non-AerialSphere Maps. End User will not use the AerialSphere Maps Content in a End User Application that contains a non-AerialSphere map.
5. No Circumventing Fees. End User will not circumvent the applicable Fees. For example, End User will not create multiple Accounts to avoid incurring Fees, prevent AerialSphere from accurately calculating End User’s Subscription Service usage levels, or abuse any free Services.
